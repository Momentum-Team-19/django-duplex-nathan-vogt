Stretch goal for each project: trying new things

Logged in users can add code snippets.
Logged in users can search their own code snippets and get results.
Each user has a profile page that shows their public code snippets. Other users can copy 
a snippet with one click, adding it to their library of snippets.

A snippet has code (required), a language (required), a title (optional), and 
whatever other fields make sense. Some ideas to consider: a description or a list of tags.

If you copy a snippet by clicking the copy button (or whatever UI element is used for 
this purpose), there's a link back to the original snippet. The easiest way to do this 
is with a foreign key. One should be able to see how many times a snippet has been copied.

The original snippet creator can edit their snippet; the copying user can edit their copy.

How search works
Search should look for terms in the title, in other fields like a description or tags, 
and in the language field. If I search for "javascript auth," I should see any snippets 
I have about authentication using JavaScript. See search in the Django documentation for 
some ideas.

How much of this is JavaScript?
This can vary, but the two parts that definitely need JavaScript are syntax highlighting 
and copying a code snippet to your clipboard.

For syntax highlighting, check out Prism.js or Highlight.js.
